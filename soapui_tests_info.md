# SoapUI Tests
SoapUI is used for automated testing of complete requests (not Unit-testing!)

The current test setup is stored in `soapui_tests.xml` and can be imported into SoapUI. 

## Users
To execute the tests you need to have the following users in your server:

* test_admin (password: 1234) has all privileges granted
